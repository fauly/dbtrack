# Questions for Clarification

1. **Database Structure**: What specific tables and relationships do you envision for the daily logger, purchase tracker, and other core functions? Any particular fields you want to prioritize?
I don't have specific ideas beyond what I've mentioned. The tables I think we'll need are probably:
DailyLogs
Quantities
Ingredients - relates to quantities
Recipes - can relate to self, ingredients (and so in turn quantities)
BakingLogs - Relates to recipes

2. **CRUD Operations**: For the CRUD API, do you have a preferred framework or library in mind for handling these operations, or are you open to suggestions?

No library or framework - We are using godaddy, if you check the oldcodebase you'll see the local sql I think we were using. Whatever works best!

3. **OCR Integration**: Regarding the purchase tracker, how critical is the OCR functionality in the initial version? Should we focus on the basic CRUD operations first?
Lets ignore ocr for now.

4. **Nested Recipes**: Can you clarify how you want to handle the data for nested recipes? Should they be stored as separate entries in the database, or linked in some way to the main recipe?
I don't know what the best way is to do this. If it was object oriented I would essentially store a reference to the recipe from the recipe database - and then we would get data from that. Not too sure.

1. **Autosave Feature**: How frequently do you want the autosave feature to trigger? Should it save every change, or at specific intervals?
Lets just save every change if it can be efficient enough - just the fields we're editing.

2. **Baking Log**: What specific data points do you want to capture in the baking log? Are there any additional metrics or fields you think would be useful?
I'm not sure - as I mentioned specific things would probably
Recipe Reference
Notes
Time started - Time Ended
Baker
Batch code (hopefully autogenerated)
Servings Type - Servings Reference Unit (Grams or milliliters etc) - Servings quantity.
